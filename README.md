# Numerical-modelling-of-weather-and-climate
The lecture note and project from the course "Numerical modelling of weather and climate" given by Prof Schaer and Prof Lohmann in ETH Zurich

The folder "Numberical Modelling" has all the files for projects, whereas other files are lecture notes, tutorial notes and other materials for the lecture.

The course provides an introduction into the following themes: numerical methods (finite differences and spectral methods); adiabatic formulation of atmospheric models (vertical coordinates, hydrostatic approximation); parameterization of physical processes (e.g. clouds, convection, boundary layer, radiation); atmospheric data assimilation and weather prediction; predictability (chaos-theory, ensemble methods); climate models (coupled atmospheric, oceanic and biogeochemical models); climate prediction. Hands-on experience with simple models will be acquired in the tutorials.
